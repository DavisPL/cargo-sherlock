"2024-06-23 15:15:21.919829 |INFO | [rudra-progress] Running cargo rudra
2024-06-23 15:15:22.289366 |ERROR| [rudra-progress] Could not obtain Cargo metadata
Error during execution of `cargo metadata`: error: failed to parse manifest at `/tmp/rudra/Cargo.toml`

Caused by:
  feature `strip` is required

  The package requires the Cargo feature called `strip`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.57.0-nightly (7fbbf4e8f 2021-10-19)).
  Consider adding `cargo-features = [""strip""]` to the top of Cargo.toml (above the [package] table) to tell Cargo you are opting in to use this unstable feature.
  See https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-strip-option for more information about the status of this feature.
