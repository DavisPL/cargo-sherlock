audits,-,Critical,zcash,safe-to-deploy,0.8.16 -> 0.8.17,,"- Build script change removes some now-unused config flags, and checks for thread\n  sanitization to enable this on `crossbeam`.\n- Changes to `unsafe` blocks are to move them, or to introduce a couple of new\n  blocks identical to equivalent earlier blocks (now that MSRV is new enough to\n  access newer `Atomic*` methods).\n",
audits,-,Critical,zcash,safe-to-deploy,0.8.17 -> 0.8.18,,Changes to `unsafe` code are to construct and drop `MaybeUninit<T>` directly\nvia its methods (one of which is now usable with the new MSRV) instead of via\ncasting.\n,
