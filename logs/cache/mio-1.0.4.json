The\\n  `..unsafe { mem::zeroed() }` in `sys::unix::selector::kqueue` looks weird\\n  but AFAICT is saying \\\"take any unspecified fields from an instance of this\\n  struct that has been zero-initialized\\\", which is fine for integer fields. It\\n  would be nice if there was documentation to this effect (explaining why this\\n  is done instead of `..Default::default()`).\\n- Calls to Windows API methods. These are either pre-existing (and altered for\\n  the differences in the crate abstractions), or newly added in logic that\\n  appears to be copied from miow 0.3.6 (I scanned this by eye and didn't see\\n  any noteworthy changes other than handling windows-sys API differences).\\n"
