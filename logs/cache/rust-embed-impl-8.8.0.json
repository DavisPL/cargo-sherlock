This is a limitation\\nof how `Path::canonicalize` relies on filesystem resolution, and cannot\\ncanonicalize a path that does not exist.\\n\\nThis change was made as part of adding a default-disabled `allow_missing`\\nattribute, and the generator is gated on a check that the non-canonicalized path\\nexists (if the new attribute is off), so there should not be any changes to\\nexisting usage.\\n"
