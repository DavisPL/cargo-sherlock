The closest upstream SHA was\\ncf89cf35037f152ce7adfeca864656de5d33ea1e with 8 lines of output from\\n`diff --recursive . ../../libz-sys-1.1.12/src/zlib-ng/`. All of these referenced\\nfiles that were only present in libz-sys, and they're all presumably irrelevant\\n(CI configuration files, .git files, linter config)\\n"
