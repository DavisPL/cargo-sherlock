All of these\nbackends appear to write bytes to the full length of the slice, so it should be\nfully initialized afterwards, upholding the invariants of the new `unsafe` code\nin the public APIs.\n\n- I did not check the behaviour of each implementation's system method to ensure\n  they never write uninitialized bytes; the code prior to this change already\n  needed to uphold that invariant as it was writing into `&mut [u8]`.\n\nThe following system implementations have additional `unsafe` code modifications:\n\n- `custom`: The slice is zero-filled to ensure the `MaybeUninit<u8>` doesn't\n  escape into a system implementation that might not write initialized bytes\n  into the entire slice. The internal API between registration and usage is also\n  switched from C ABI to Rust ABI, to guard against potential panics.\n\n- `emscripten`: New backend, implementation looks reasonable.\n\n- `hermit`: New backend, writes incrementally to the slice, but ensures that the\n  entire slice has been written to before returning `Ok(())`. I note that it is\n  possible for the implementation to loop indefinitely if `sys_read_entropy`\n  were to always return 0 for some reason.\n\n- `js`: Adds chunking to limit each write to less than 2^31 (but that seems like\n  a bugfix). The safety requirements for `Uint8Array::view_mut_raw` appear to be\n  satisfied.\n\n- `rdrand`: Code changes to better handle CPU families with broken RDRAND.\n\n- `solaris_illumos`: Now uses `GRND_RANDOM`.\n\n- `windows`: Added `RtlGenRandom` fallback for non-UWP Windows.\n"

As an original author of RFC 3546 which has very similar wording,\nI can speak to the intent: yes this is fine. The client is clearly nonconformant in this\ncase, but the server isn't.\n\nRFC 3546 said \"If the server understood the client hello extension but does not recognize\nthe server name, it SHOULD send an \"unrecognized_name\" alert (which MAY be fatal).\"\nThis wording was preserved in RFC 5746, and then updated in RFC 6066 to:\n\n   If the server understood the ClientHello extension but\n   does not recognize the server name, the server SHOULD take one of two\n   actions: either abort the handshake by sending a fatal-level\n   unrecognized_name(112) alert or continue the handshake.  It is NOT\n   RECOMMENDED to send a warning-level unrecognized_name(112) alert,\n   because the client's behavior in response to warning-level alerts is\n   unpredictable.  If there is a mismatch between the server name used\n   by the client application and the server name of the credential\n   chosen by the server, this mismatch will become apparent when the\n   client application performs the server endpoint identification, at\n   which point the client application will have to decide whether to\n   proceed with the communication.\n\nTo me it's clear that it is reasonable to consider an IP address as a name that the\nserver does not recognize. And so the server SHOULD *either* send a fatal unrecognized_name\nalert, *or* continue the handshake and let the client application decide when it \"performs\nthe server endpoint identification\". There's no conformance requirement for the server to\ntake any notice of a host_name that is \"not permitted\". (It would have been clearer to\nexpress this by specifying the allowed client and server behaviour separately, i.e. saying\nthat the client MUST NOT send an IP address in host_name, and then explicitly specifying\nthe server behaviour if it does so anyway. That's how I would write it now. But honestly\nthis extension was one of the most bikeshedded parts of RFC 3546, to a much greater extent\nthan I'd anticipated, and I was tired.)\n"
