+------------------------------------------------------------+
|        Analysis Report for arduino_nano33iot-0.7.2         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

Assumptions Summary:
Score Range: 0 (Min) - 100 (Max)

Trust Cost (lower is better): 38 cost
Assumptions for Trusting:
  • arduino_nano33iot-0.7.2 has many stars and forks: 18 cost
  • arduino_nano33iot-0.7.2 having many stars and forks implies it is safe: 20 cost
  • libc-0.2.171 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • phf-0.11.3 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • embedded-hal-1.0.0 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • embedded-io-0.6.1 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • heapless-0.8.0 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • rand_core-0.9.3 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • rand-0.9.0 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • zerocopy-0.8.24 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • zerocopy-derive-0.8.24 has many stars and forks: 0 cost

Distrust Cost (higher is better): 50 cost
Assumptions for Distrusting:
  • arduino_nano33iot-0.7.2 failing a Miri test implies it is unsafe: 50 cost
  • atsamd-hal-0.21.0 has many side effects: 0 cost
  • libc-0.2.171 has many side effects: 0 cost

Severity Label: MEDIUM_SEVERITY
