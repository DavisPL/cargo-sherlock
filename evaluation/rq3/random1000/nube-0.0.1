+------------------------------------------------------------+

Assumptions Summary:
Score Range: 0 (Min) - 100 (Max)

Trust Cost (lower is better): 83 cost
Assumptions for Trusting:
  • nube-0.0.1 has many downloads: 58 cost
  • nube-0.0.1 having many downloads implies it is safe: 25 cost
  • rand_core-0.9.3 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • sha3-0.10.8 has many stars and forks: 0 cost
  • generic-array-1.2.0 has many downloads: 0 cost
  • cpufeatures-0.2.17 has many downloads: 0 cost
  • libc-0.2.171 has many stars and forks: 0 cost

Distrust Cost (higher is better): 50 cost
Assumptions for Distrusting:
  • nube-0.0.1 failing a Miri test implies it is unsafe: 50 cost
  • libc-0.2.171 has many side effects: 0 cost
